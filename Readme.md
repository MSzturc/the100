# THE 100, the fastest 3D Printer based on a printed frame.

- It does Speedboat in less than 6 minutes and is capable of doing high quality prints in **1/10th** of the time a Ender 3 would need.
- By the time releasing, The 100 is at the 26th rank of the [leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lFiJi-X3Xm3hh3I9Ty9dfACMiBWxHFAOUeiU1km9m6I/edit#gid=106736391) of the fastest printers in the world and it's the fastest one that uses a 3d printed frame.
- And the best thing, this printer **100% open source**. Which means if you like this printer and you  like to build one by own, you find all resources needed to do this in this repository

## Print Settings

To print the STL files, a 3D printer with a print bed of at least 230x230mm is required.
I've printed all parts out of PLA. If you plan to print ABS/ASA on the printer i would suggest to print the print bed out of a more temprature resistant material.

For all STL Parts **exept the print bed** i've used the following settings:

- 0.25 Layer height
- 0.5 Line width
- 3 Top layers
- 3 Bottom layers
- 3 Walls
- 25% Infill
- Grid Infill Pattern

**For the print bed:**
- 30% Infill

The infill of the print bed needs to be slightly higher to move the center of gravity to where the lead screws are attached. This is needed to stop binding on the Z-Axis.
